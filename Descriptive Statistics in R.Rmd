Create a data frame ‘newsurvey’ that contains the survey data in MASS package after removing the NA values. Use it for answering following queries:

```{r}
rm(list=ls())
#MASS Library
library(MASS)
#Loading the dplyr package
library(dplyr)
```

```{r}
#cleaning data
data(survey)
newsurvey <- na.omit(survey)
View(newsurvey)
str(newsurvey)

View(sur)
```

1. How many left and right handers are there?

```{r}
newsurvey %>% group_by(W.Hnd)%>%
  summarize(count=n())
```

2. Find the relative frequency distribution of left and right handers and display them with the precision of two decimal places.

```{r}
options(digits=2)
whand_frequency=table(survey$W.Hnd)
size=nrow(survey)
whand_rel_frequency=whand_frequency/size
whand_rel_frequency
```

3. Display the male left hander and female left hander in the column format.

```{r}
newsurvey%>%
  filter(W.Hnd =='Left')%>%
group_by(Sex)%>%
summarize(count=n())
```

4. What percentage of male right handers never smokes?

```{r}
male_left_handers <- newsurvey %>%
  filter(W.Hnd =='Right' & Sex == 'Male',Smoke =='Never')

sizeA = nrow(male_left_handers)
sizeB =nrow(newsurvey)

(sizeA/sizeB)*100

```

5. Find the range of students’ height participated in the survey.


```{r}
range(newsurvey$Height)
```

```{r}
max <- max(newsurvey$Height)
min <- min(newsurvey$Height)
Height_range <- max - min
Height_range
```


6. Break the height range into non-overlapping sub-intervals by defining a sequence of equal distance break points of 10 by rounding the range to nearest integer.

```{r}
break_Height = seq(150, 210, by=10)
break_Height
```

7. Find the distribution of the height range according to the sub-intervals with cut with its right boundary opened. Display it in column form.

```{r}
Height_range = cut(newsurvey$Height, break_Height, right=FALSE)

Height_range_frequency = table(Height_range)
cbind(Height_range_frequency)
```

8. Which height range of students has mostly participated in the survey?

```{r}
max(Height_range_frequency)
which.max(Height_range_frequency)
```

9. Compute the mean, variance and standard deviation of the height of the students participated in the survey.

```{r}
mean <- mean(newsurvey$Height)
mean

variance <- var(newsurvey$Height)
variance

sd <- sd(newsurvey$Height)
sd
```

10. Which category of clap students has the maximum writing hand span?

```{r}
sum_span <- newsurvey %>%
  group_by(Clap)%>%
  summarise(sum_writing_span=sum(Wr.Hnd))%>%
  arrange(desc(sum_writing_span))
sum_span
```

```{r}
head(sum_span, 1)['Clap']
```

11. Compute the covariance and correlation between height and writing span.

```{r}
cov(newsurvey$Height, newsurvey$Wr.Hnd)
```

```{r}
cor(newsurvey$Height, newsurvey$Wr.Hnd)
```

12. Display the 30%, 60% and 80% percentile of the height data.
```{r}
percentile_height=quantile(newsurvey$Height, c(.30,.60,.80))
percentile_height
```

Frame any three questions on descriptive statistics to analyse the categorical & quantitative variables present in the data of your choice.

1. Find the range of age, break the range into sub intervals by defining a sequence of equal distance break points of 10, display the distribution of age according to the sub-intervals.

```{r}
str(newsurvey)
age=newsurvey$Age
range(age)
```

```{r}
break2=seq(15,75,by=10)
break2
```

```{r}
age_cut=cut(age,break2)
table(age_cut)
```

2. Find the gender category which has maximum participants who never smoke.

```{r}
newsurvey%>%
  group_by(Sex)%>%
  filter(Smoke=="Never")%>%
  summarize(count=n())%>%
  arrange(desc(count))%>%
  head(1)
```

3. Find the percentage of participants who exercise frequently and never smoke.

```{r}
perc <- newsurvey%>%
  filter(Exer=="Freq",Smoke=="Never")
nrow(perc)/nrow(newsurvey)*100
```
