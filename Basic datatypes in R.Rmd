1. Assign a numeric value to a variable ‘a’ and convert ‘a’ into an integer.
```{r}
a <- 15
as.integer(a)
```

2. Make this quote into an R string – “Do you think this is a game?”, he said. “No, I think Jenga’s a game”, Archer responded.
```{r}
quote <- "Do you think this is a game?”, he said. “No, I think Jenga’s a game”, Archer responded."
print(quote)

```

3. Create two numeric vectors p & q
```{r}
p <- c(0.2,0.4)
p

q <- c(1.2,1.4)
q
```

4. Use R as a calculator to do basic arithmetic operations on p &q and store each result in different variables.
```{r}
a=p+q
a
```

```{r}
b=p-q
b
```

```{r}
c=p*q
c
```

```{r}
d=p/q
d
```

5. Calculate sqrt(a) and perform log2 transformation on the result.

```{r}
a <- 49
sqrt(a)
```


```{r}
result=log(a,2)
result
```

6. Calculate the 10-based logarithm of 100 and multiply the result with cosine of π.

```{r}
l=log(100,10)
l
```


```{r}
res=l*-1 #cos(pi)=-1
res
```

7. Create a vector ‘x’ using : operator from -2 to 2.
```{r}
x <- -2:2
x
```

8. Print the dimension and length of x.
```{r}
dim(x)
```

```{r}
length(x)
```

9. Create two vectors small and caps with last 5 alphabets in lower case and first 5 alphabets in upper case respectively. Bind it row and columnwise.

```{r}
small <- c('A','B','C','D','E','f','g','h','i','j')
caps <- c('P','Q','R','S','T','u','v','w','x','y')
rbind(small,caps)
```

```{r}
cbind(small,caps)
```

10. Create matrix M=(1,2,5;-4,8,6;3,-1,7) and find matrix MxMxM.
```{r}
M <- matrix(c(1,2,5,-4,8,6,3,-1,7),nrow=3,ncol=3)
resm=M*M*M #does atrix multiplication
resm
```

11. Find the result of elementwise multiplication of M by M.
```{r}
element=M*M
element
```

12. Find the transpose, inverse and determinant of M.
```{r}
t(M) #transpose of matrix
```

```{r}
solve(M) #inverse of matrix
```

```{r}
det(M)  #determinant of a matrix
```
